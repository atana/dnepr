WARNING:Place:837 - Partially locked IO Bus is found. 
    Following components of the bus are not locked: 
   	 Comp: LEDS<0>

WARNING:Place:838 - An IO Bus with more than one IO standard is found.
   Components associated with this bus are as follows: 
   	 Comp: LEDS<2>   IOSTANDARD = PCI33_3
   	 Comp: LEDS<1>   IOSTANDARD = PCI33_3
   	 Comp: LEDS<0>   IOSTANDARD = LVCMOS25


INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 177 IOs, 173 are locked
   and 4 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.

Phase 3.31
WARNING:Place:479 - Use of the left PPC405 has been detected. The left processor
   requires special design considerations when operating above 350 MHz in the -7
   speed grade part. Please see Xilinx Application Note XAPP755 for details.

WARNING:Place:83 - This design either uses more than 8 clock buffers or has clock buffers locked into primary and
   secondary sites. Since only one clock buffer output signal from a primary / secondary pair may enter any clock region
   it is necessary to partition the clock logic being driven by these clocks into different clock regions. It may be
   possible through Floorplanning all or just part of the logic being driven by the Global clocks to achieve a legal
   placement for this design.........................................
